Big fan of iron man
iron man introduced all the emerging tech sound
particularly fasinicated by the character jarvis
like how it differetiate from the modern days AIs
studied it through rewatching scenes in the movie,
and the tracks that people extracted from the experimental jarvis app marvel released 8 years ago

sorry this might be convetional
